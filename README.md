💡 About The Project
This is the frontend client for the  e-commerce platform, built entirely with React. It is responsible for the entire user interface and experience, including product display, shopping cart management, user authentication forms, and the checkout process.

This client is designed to consume data from a separate backend API (not included in this repository) to display dynamic content.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the latest versions of the following installed:

Node.js (v16.x or higher)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [your-frontend-repository-url]
cd [project-folder-name]
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
Set up Environment Variables:

Create a file named .env in the root directory. You must point the application to the backend API endpoint.

Code snippet

# The base URL for the backend API
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=[Your_Backend_API_URL, e.g., http://localhost:5000/api/v1]

# [Optional: Any third-party keys, e.g., Stripe Public Key]
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[Your_Stripe_Publishable_Key]
Run the application:

Bash

npm start
# or
yarn start
The application will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

🗂️ Project Structure
The codebase is organized into logical folders for easy navigation:

src/
├── assets/          # Images, SVGs, Fonts
├── components/      # Reusable UI elements (e.g., Button, ProductCard)
├── context/         # Global state management using Context/Redux slices
├── hooks/           # Custom React Hooks
├── pages/           # Components that represent a full page (e.g., Home, Cart, Checkout)
├── services/        # API communication logic (e.g., axios config, API calls)
├── styles/          # Global styles, theme files
└── App.js           # Main application component
🎨 Styling and Design
Technology: [e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, CSS Modules]

Theme: The primary color scheme, typography, and spacing are defined in src/styles/theme.js (or similar file) to maintain design consistency.

Customization: All major UI components are found in the src/components directory and can be easily customized.

🔗 API Integration
All network requests to the backend API are managed in the src/services folder. We use [e.g., Axios/Fetch] for making HTTP requests.

The main API endpoints this client interacts with are:

Action	HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
Get Products	GET	/products	Retrieves the list of all products.
User Login	POST	/auth/login	Authenticates a user.
Place Order	POST	/orders	Submits a new order and payment details.
