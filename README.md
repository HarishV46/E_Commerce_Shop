## 💡 About The Project

This is the **frontend client** for the [Project Name] e-commerce platform, built entirely with **React**. It is responsible for the entire user interface and experience, including product display, shopping cart management, user authentication forms, and the checkout process.

This client is designed to consume data from a separate backend API (not included in this repository) to display dynamic content.



## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the latest versions of the following installed:

  * **Node.js** (v16.x or higher)
  * **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your-frontend-repository-url]
    cd [project-folder-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```



4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The codebase is organized into logical folders for easy navigation:

```
src/
├── assets/          # Images, SVGs, Fonts
├── components/      # Reusable UI elements (e.g., Button, ProductCard)
├── context/         # Global state management using Context/Redux slices
├── hooks/           # Custom React Hooks
├── pages/           # Components that represent a full page (e.g., Home, Cart, Checkout)
├── services/        # API communication logic (e.g., axios config, API calls)
├── styles/          # Global styles, theme files
└── App.js           # Main application component
```

-----

## 🎨 Styling and Design

  * **Technology:** **[e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, CSS Modules]**
  * **Theme:** The primary color scheme, typography, and spacing are defined in `src/styles/theme.js` (or similar file) to maintain design consistency.
  * **Customization:** All major UI components are found in the `src/components` directory and can be easily customized.

-----

## 🔗 API Integration

All network requests to the backend API are managed in the `src/services` folder. We use **[e.g., Axios/Fetch]** for making HTTP requests.

The main API endpoints this client interacts with are:

| Action | HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Get Products | `GET` | `/products` | Retrieves the list of all products. |
| User Login | `POST` | `/auth/login` | Authenticates a user. |
| Place Order | `POST` | `/orders` | Submits a new order and payment details. |
